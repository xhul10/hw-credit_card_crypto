    ## Suggested steps for double transposition cipher
    # 1. find number of rows/cols such that matrix is almost square
    # 2. break plaintext into evenly sized blocks
    # 3. sort rows in predictibly random way using key as seed
    # 4. sort columns of each row in predictibly random way
    # 5. return joined cyphertext
  end
