# Credit Card Crypto

This assignment requires you to try your hand out at a very common error checking (data integrity) algorithm, and also introduces you to very elementary cryptographic algorithms.

## Retrieving Files
1. Make sure to setup the git tool as we described in class (see handout). Also, make sure to creat your own RSA keypair and link your public key to Github. You can then clone any public project from Github onto your local machine.
2. Fork this project on Github (a copy is created in your Github account)
3. Clone *your copy* of the forked project onto your local machine:
`$ git clone git@github.com:[your_username]/hw_3-credit_card_crypto.git`
4. Use the 'bundle' gem (which you should have installed earlier) to install all gems required for this assignment (listed in the `Gemfile`) onto your local machine: `$ bundle install`

## Working on Assignment
While working on this assignment, frequently save your work and push it back to your Github repo:

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Enter meaningful description here"
    $ git push -u origin master

After the first time you have pushed using `-u origin master`, you can subsequently push it simply by doing:

    $ git push

Remember that all members of your team should attempt each part of the assignment and push your individual work to Github. *You may work together* and share code and ideas. However, *only one person should submit the assignment* (see details at bottom).

## Requirements

This project is in two parts. One part is about the Luhn algorithm for credit card number validation. The other part uses the basic crypto algorithms we saw in class.

### A. Luhn Algorithm
You will write the algorithm used by financial institutions to check whether a credit card number is valid or not, by checking its last digit (checksum). This is done by using the [Luhn Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm). You can see this algorithm in action at any [online Luhn algorithm calculator](http://planetcalc.com/2464/).

1. Implement the file called `luhn_validator.rb`. There is one method you must fill out, called `validate_checksum()`. It must check a credit card number and return (`true`/`false`) whether the last checksum digit is correct.
2. Implement the file called `credit_card.rb` (see TODO comments):
  - mixin the LuhnValidator
  - initialize the instance variables
  - create a hash that converts the instance variables in a [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) string format

Finally, make sure it passes all the tests I have also provided:

    $ ruby spec/luhn_spec.rb

(run the spec file from the root directory of your solution)

### B. Substitution Ciphers
Your team will implement two ciphers that we saw in class: the Caesar Cipher and the Permutation Cipher.

- Implement the `SubstitutionCipher` module in `substitution_cipher.rb`
  - Create encrypt and decrypt methods of both ciphers
    - they all take `document` string and `key` integer
    - they all return a string (encrypted or decrypted)
  - Assumptions you may make:
    - All `document` characters are printable ASCII (ord 32-126)
    - Caesar cipher: there is not need to 'wrap' values -- just add/subtract the key to encrypt/decrypt
    - Permutation cipher: assume you can replace with any characters values from 0-127 (ord)
  - Make sure the decrypt method recreates the original document it is given!

Finally, make sure it passes all the tests I have also provided:

      $ ruby spec/crypto_spec.rb

### C. Advanced Ciphers and Testing
Your team must implement the double transposition and AES ciphers we saw in class:

- Implement the two new ciphers:
  - DoubleTranspositionCipher in `double_trans_cipher.rb`
  - AesCipher in aes_cipher.rb
- Write more tests for these ciphers in `spec/crypto_spec.rb`
  - Can you DRY out all the tests using metaprogramming as we saw in class?

## Submission
Please submit one solution for your team. You may simply submit the HTTP url of the git repository where we can find your solution.
